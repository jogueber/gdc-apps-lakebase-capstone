# Capstone — Databricks Apps + Lakebase


FOR REVIEWERS: please check [the review doc](Review.md).

## Install

Run this in a clean directory on your laptop:
```
brew upgrade databricks
```

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnshubham-db/gdc-apps-lakebase-capstone/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer is interactive — it will prompt for a Databricks CLI profile,
catalog name, warehouse, Lakebase config, etc. Total time: ~10–15 min.

**The installer installs nothing on your machine.** It uses only what you
already have: `bash`, `curl`, `tar`, `python3` (stdlib only — for JSON
parsing), and the `databricks` CLI. All Python / SDK work happens server-side
in your Databricks workspace.

### Prerequisites

- [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/install.html) (≥ 0.230) authed with at least one profile (`databricks auth login --profile <name>`)
- `python3` on `PATH` (preinstalled on macOS / Linux)
- A **Serverless SQL Warehouse** in the workspace (the installer lets you pick from a list)
- Workspace permissions: create catalogs, create database instances (Lakebase), create dashboards / Genie spaces, run jobs
- One FEVM workspace, request using go/fevm, recommended to use azure stable workspace.

## What the installer does

| Step | Provisions | How |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Gold Delta tables (`customers`, `transactions`, `products`, `support_tickets`, `customer_segments`) | runs `01_generate_gold_data.py` as an ephemeral job |
| 2 | Lakebase (managed Postgres) instance + UC registration + secret scope | runs `02_create_lakebase_instance.py` |
| 3 | Lakeview AI/BI dashboard (5 widgets, anomalies highlighted) | runs `04_create_aibi_dashboard.py` |
| 4 | Genie space scoped to the 5 gold tables | runs `05_create_genie_space.py` |
| 5 | Drops the **blank scaffold** into a directory you choose | local `cp -r` + writes `app/.env` |


## What you build

Everything else. Every file under `app/`, `resources/`, `lakebase/`,
`examples/`, and `tests/` is a 0-byte stub. Open
[`capstone-scaffold/CAPSTONE_TASKS.md`](./capstone-scaffold/CAPSTONE_TASKS.md)
and work through tasks T1–T9 — that document is the source of truth.

For a simpler version, open [`capstone-scaffold/CAPSTONE_TASKS_STREAMLIT.md`](./capstone-scaffold/CAPSTONE_TASKS_STREAMLIT.md) for streamlit based solution.

```

## Troubleshooting

- **"No SQL warehouses visible"** — your profile lacks workspace access; double-check with `databricks current-user me --profile <name>`.
- **Notebook 02 hangs** — Lakebase provisioning takes 1–3 min; the installer polls every 8s. If it times out >5 min, check the `Run URL` printed.
- **Notebook 04 dashboard shows "No data"** — re-run only notebook 04 (the installer does this automatically) and verify the warehouse you picked is *running*.
